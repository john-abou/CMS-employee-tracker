## Description
This repository was built to practice many of the skills I accumulated over the last month including -- node.js, express.js, modularization, http requests, SQL, and prepared statements. Currently, the CMS employee tracker allows the user to read , add, and edit data in a table that is hosted on their local server. In the future, I would like to edit my SQL code so it uses OOP to structure the queries. Also, I'd like to use jest to ensure the classes and prompts work as intended, also so that the expected errors are being thrown where necessary. This was a great learning experience and it was great practice for building my own apps. I can't wait to start working with HTML and CSS to make everything come full circle and build a fullstack app.

## Installation
My project can be installed from github -- the link is: https://github.com/john-abou/CMS-employee-tracker

## Usage
My project requires the use of the user's localhost/server. The user should have 2 terminals going to use my app, one will to turn on the server so it listens for any incoming requests. The second terminal will be to run the CLI app. The server can be started by running "npm start" in the command line, and the app can be started by running "npm run start" in the command line.

Before you can run the app, please ensure that you install the corresponding dependencies by running "npm i" in the command line. Also, run the schema.sql file in your MySQL workbench to create the database and tables. I have added a line to the schema.sql file to automatically run the seed file to populate the tables with sample data. If you would like to add your own data, you can do so by running the seed.sql file in your MySQL workbench.
